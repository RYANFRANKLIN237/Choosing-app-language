# Choosing-app-language
This flutter project enables users to choose between english and french  as their app language, the choice is persisted during app sessions using GetStorage so that even if the user closes and reopens the app , the app language is the language the user chose.

## Here's what makes the project thick:

-  **Flutter Localization:** Leverages flutter's robust Localization capabilities to deliver perfectly translated app content based on user selection.
- **Getx Storage:** Saves the preferred language preference across app sessions using GetX storage, ensuring a consistent experience.
- **Clean Architecture & Design Patterns:** Built with a focus on maintainability and scalability, employing clean architecture principles and design patterns(MVC)
